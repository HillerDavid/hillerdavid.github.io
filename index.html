                    My name is David Hiller. I am a proud disney cast member, advocate of all things nerd culture, and
                    future full stack web developer. Currently I am enrolled in UCF coding bootcamp in partnership with
                    Trilogy Education Services. Within our curriculum, I have obtained skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript,
                    jQuery and Node.js. Looking to the future, I am excited to contribute my skills as a
                    web developer to the other areas of my life.

                    Disney has always had a special place in my life growing up, as it has in
                    many other people. The magic in Disney has been it's ability to create happiness. As a cast member
                    of Walt Disney World, I have the privilege to create that magic. Making magic for others by being
                    a part of the web development team would be a dream opportunity.
